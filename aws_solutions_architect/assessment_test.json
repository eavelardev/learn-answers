However, you don’t want it to add more than one instance every five minutes. Which scaling policie should you use?",
        "answer": "A simple scaling policy changes the group size and then has a cooldown period before doing so again. Step scaling policies don’t have cooldown periods. Target tracking policies attempt to keep a metric at a set value. PercentChangeInCapacity is a simple scaling adjustment type, not a scaling policy. See"
