# learn-answers
Program to learn the answers of a set of questions

I think that one of the best ways to learn new things y through repetion, for that reason I did this program for learn the answers of a set of questions in a fun way, importing that information from a JSON.

## Using

```
python learn_answers.py --file <my source code file>
```

example:

```
python learn_answers.py --file handson-ml2/chapter1_The\ Machine\ Learning\ Landscape.json
```

Bug: The program crash when you use a small terminal size.
